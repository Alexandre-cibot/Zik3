# Welcome to Zik3!
Zik3 adding Bluetooth support on Mac OS 10.13 for the headphones Parrot Zik 3.

The origin of the code is the following project: http://picaso.github.io/parrot-zik-status/
which stopped working with MacOS 10.13.
I mostly used the patch proposed here: https://github.com/picaso/parrot-zik-status/issues/14#issuecomment-347964583
